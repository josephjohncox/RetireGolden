# @retiregolden/engine

Pure-TypeScript retirement-planning engine — the calculation core of
[RetireGolden](https://retiregolden.app/). It projects a household's finances
year by year and models federal + state taxes, Social Security (claiming,
spousal/survivor, PIA from earnings), RMDs, Roth conversions, withdrawal
strategies, insurance, Monte Carlo, and an LP-based optimizer.

Source of truth: [github.com/RetireGolden/RetireGolden](https://github.com/RetireGolden/RetireGolden)
(`packages/engine`). Engineering docs live in the repo's `DOCS/`.

## Runtime contract

- **ESM, Node ≥ 20** (also bundles cleanly for browsers). No CommonJS build.
- **No browser globals, no ambient network, no persistence.** The engine never
  touches `fetch`, `localStorage`, `indexedDB`, or the DOM — enforced by lint.
  IO always crosses an injection seam owned by the consumer:
  - anything stochastic takes an injected seedable RNG (`montecarlo/rng`);
  - the optimizer loads the HiGHS wasm via an optional `locateFile` option
    (`strategies/optimizer`);
  - FedInvest TIPS prices: the engine only parses CSV text
    (`ladder/fedInvest`); fetching and caching are the consumer's job.
- **Deterministic.** Same plan + same options ⇒ bit-identical results.
- Structural evidence-ID hashing is package-internal. Public action boundaries
  accept evidence produced by their canonical upstream boundaries; they do not
  expose a general object hasher. JavaScript cannot reliably detect `Proxy`
  wrappers, so the internal hasher's contract is limited to freshly rebuilt,
  trusted plain data trees and is not a hostile-object validation boundary.
- The owned-IRA penalty prerequisite can accept raw annual SEPP schedule routes,
  rebuild each route's complete inventory from canonical annual character, and
  issue final `iraSeppQualified` zero-penalty decisions only after complete
  reconciliation and exact payment rejoin. Non-success routes remain pending
  and supply no negative-SEPP authority. The pure annual finalizer and
  movement-candidate coordinator now forward these raw routes, accept the
  final qualified outcome, preserve detailed route diagnostics when blocked,
  and bind compact canonical route results into annual evidence. Their public
  staged-date ID builder reproduces planning evidence only; exact coordinator
  rejoin remains the authority, and neither boundary commits movement or
  establishes actionability.
- `coordinatePlanOwnedNonRothIraAnnualWithdrawalCandidate` adds
  Plan-identity-authoritative, runtime-snapshot-bound planning evidence around
  that coordinator. It derives the complete Plan owner/year ordinary-withdrawal
  batch and owned non-Roth IRA pool, then requires complete, consistently dated
  opening, year-end, annual basis/line-7, line-8, and exact alive evidence. It
  remains pure and noncommitting: every result keeps movement uncommitted and
  actionability unestablished.
- `buildAnnualRetirementPhysicalEventInventory` is the pure chronology boundary
  in front of future simulator integration. It derives traditional-account Plan
  action allocations internally and exact-rejoins a complete Plan/year/ledger-run
  runtime inventory covering RMD, automatic SEPP, legacy withdrawal/conversion,
  in-year IRA/employer-plan account-balance contribution inflows and employer
  match. Aggregate legacy QCD reclassification, annuity funding, rollover
  inflows, and other traditional transfers stay unresolved until their producer
  and physical endpoints have a typed binding contract. Following-year IRA
  contributions designated for the prior tax year
  remain separate annual-basis facts, not events in this calendar-year chronology.
  A resolved contribution record is the upstream ledger's post-owner-wide-limit
  occurrence, not a contribution candidate; fully suppressed contributions are
  intentionally absent under the complete runtime attestation. The inventory
  checks Plan-local source prerequisites without duplicating shared-limit or
  section 415(c) math. A shared movement authority may cover multiple source
  members only when their owner, kind, origin, date, and sequence agree; upstream
  evidence remains unique per member. It never invents a missing owner, source,
  date, or order: incomplete records and cross-authority chronology conflicts
  fail closed. Successful output
  is a globally ordered immutable stream with owned-IRA pool views and provisional
  Form 8606/QCD categories; it still mutates no balance or basis, calculates no tax
  or penalty, and establishes neither movement nor actionability.
- `buildPlanOwnedNonRothIraAnnualPostCandidateClassificationInput` is the next
  pure evidence boundary for the standalone-compatible Plan-owned IRA batch. It
  exact-rejoins the canonical candidate, complete December 31 owner pool, basis,
  and contribution-window evidence into a frozen classifier input without
  classifying, executing, or integrating with projection.
- `preparePlanOwnedNonRothIraAnnualCandidateTransaction` is the pure provisional
  producer for that batch. It rebuilds the annual physical-event inventory,
  derives the exact Plan-owned action/source batch, and stages it against
  caller-supplied exact-cent balances. Its frozen applications and source
  transitions apply only to a detached snapshot: movement and actionability
  remain unestablished, and it publishes no December 31, tax, penalty, basis,
  or finalization claim.
- Parameters (tax brackets, limits, SSA tables, Medicare/FPL) are versioned
  data packs under `params/`, with provenance.

## Usage

Deep subpath imports are the primary API; the root export covers the core
validate-and-project loop:

```ts
import { planSchema, simulatePlan } from '@retiregolden/engine'

const plan = planSchema.parse(JSON.parse(planJson))
const result = simulatePlan(plan, { startYear: 2026 })
```

```ts
import { runMonteCarlo } from '@retiregolden/engine/montecarlo/run'
import { packForYear } from '@retiregolden/engine/params'
```

### Dated property purchases

A property account can carry an optional atomic `purchase` event:

```ts
{
  type: 'property',
  id: 'future-home',
  value: 1_000_000,
  plannedSaleYear: 2045,
  expectedNetProceeds: null,
  propertyTax: {
    mode: 'prop13',
    annualInflationCapPct: 2,
    taxRatePct: 1.1,
  },
  insurance: { mode: 'propertyValuePct', annualPct: 0.35 },
  maintenance: { mode: 'propertyValuePct', annualPct: 1 },
  purchase: {
    year: 2030,
    purchasePrice: 1_000_000,
    purchasePriceBasis: 'todayDollars',
    financing: {
      type: 'mortgage',
      downPaymentPct: 20,
      interestPct: 6,
      termYears: 30,
      payoffYear: 2040,
    },
  },
}
```

Before 2030, this account contributes no property, mortgage, carrying cost,
tax, spending, or net worth. In 2030 the engine prices the property from that
path's inflation, funds the down payment through sale proceeds, income, and the
normal withdrawal waterfall, establishes adjusted basis, creates the mortgage,
and starts a full year of mortgage and carrying costs. Cash purchases use
`financing: { type: 'cash' }`. An embedded mortgage can carry `payoffYear`; the
remaining balance is then funded through the normal withdrawal waterfall while
the property remains owned.

Purchases scheduled in the same year execute as one batch. If the full batch is
unfundable, the engine executes none of it and publishes
`skippedInsufficientFunds` in `YearResult.propertyAcquisitions`. Purchase cash is
a capital transaction reported in `propertyAcquisitionOutlay`; it is not added
to `YearExpenses` or spending-success measures. A purchase event before the
projection start fails closed: represent that property and mortgage as opening
accounts instead. Combining an in-projection purchase with a HECM on the same
property is not supported.

Property tax supports fixed annual dollars, a percentage of opening market
value, or a planning-grade `prop13` assessment. The Prop 13 mode establishes
base-year value at acquisition, caps later positive assessment inflation at the
configured rate, and taxes the lower of factored base or market value. The
caller supplies the effective tax rate, including any local bonded-debt levy.
It does not infer exclusions, portability, supplemental assessments, new
construction, or partial ownership changes. Insurance and maintenance each
support fixed annual dollars or a percentage of opening property value. All
three costs continue after mortgage payoff and stop in the sale year.

### Dated W-2 jobs and employer healthcare

Wage streams accept inclusive `startYear` and `endYear` fields. Each active
stream remains W-2 wages, so plans can represent job transitions and concurrent
jobs without converting compensation into generic recurring income. `endAge`
remains an additional stop gate.

A wage stream can also carry employer family coverage for the same active
window:

```ts
{
  type: 'wages',
  id: 'consulting-job',
  personId: 'person-1',
  annualGross: 300_000,
  startYear: 2036,
  endYear: 2053,
  endAge: null,
  realGrowthPct: 0,
  healthCoverage: {
    annualEmployeePremium: 12_000,
    coveredPersonIds: ['person-1', 'person-2'],
    premiumTaxTreatment: 'preTax',
    medicareCoordination: 'employerPrimary',
  },
}
```

The employee premium follows healthcare inflation and is charged once per wage
stream, not once per covered person. Active coverage suppresses the baseline
pre-65 marketplace premium for the named people. `employerPrimary` also
suppresses modeled Medicare while the job is active; `medicarePrimary` charges
Medicare alongside the employer premium. When the wage stream ends, each person
returns to the normal marketplace/Medicare rules. A pre-tax employee premium
reduces modeled ordinary wage income but leaves `incomes.wages` gross.

A versioned JSON Schema for the `Plan` document is derived from `planSchema` and
shipped both as a constant and as a static file, so a non-TypeScript consumer can
learn the plan format:

```ts
import { planJsonSchema, PLAN_SCHEMA_VERSION } from '@retiregolden/engine/schema'
```

This subpath is **zod-free** — it resolves only to the generated constant and
plain metadata, so importing it pulls in neither zod nor the plan model. The same
bytes ship as `@retiregolden/engine/schema/plan.v4.json` for offline, no-import
reads; the historical v1/v2/v3 artifacts remain available at their versioned subpaths.
The schema describes the plan's *structure*; it is necessary but not
sufficient — cross-field rules (id references, funding rules, allocation weights
summing to 100%, …) live only in `parsePlan`, which stays the full validator.
Those dropped rules are summarized in the schema's `description` and carried as a
machine-readable `x-retiregolden-unrepresentableConstraints` array on the schema
itself (also exported as `PLAN_SCHEMA_UNREPRESENTABLE_CONSTRAINTS`). The zod-backed
generator behind the artifact is `@retiregolden/engine/schema/generate`
(`generatePlanJsonSchema`), used by the build-time `pnpm generate:schema`.

The engine's own package version is available as a bare string constant, for
consumers that stamp provenance on a document they export:

```ts
import { ENGINE_VERSION } from '@retiregolden/engine/version' // or from the root
```

It is generated from `package.json` into a checked-in constant
(`pnpm generate:version`, guarded by a test) rather than read at runtime,
because the engine ships into browser bundles where there is no package.json to
read. The MCP's `build_plan` accepts this value back as `engineVersion` and warns
when a document was exported under a different engine than the one running.

Test fixtures used by the RetireGolden apps' own suites ship under
`@retiregolden/engine/testing/*` — framework-free (no vitest or other
test-runner dependency), but not part of the supported runtime API.
