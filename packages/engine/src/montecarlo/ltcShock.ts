/**
 * Probabilistic long-term-care shock for Monte Carlo (roadmap V6 §4).
 *
 * Each path may draw a paid-care episode per person — incidence, onset age, and
 * duration — so an LTC policy's risk reduction shows up in the success-rate and
 * ending-balance distribution, not just the single deterministic "LTC stress"
 * what-if. The sampled episode is injected as a plan careEvent, so the existing
 * engine offset (monthly cap × inflation rider, elimination period, benefit
 * period) applies unchanged.
 *
 * Default distribution (planning precision, editable in the UI):
 *  - incidence: ~50% of people 65+ need a significant period of *paid* LTSS
 *    (HHS/ASPE, "Long-Term Services and Supports for Older Americans").
 *  - duration: right-skewed — most need <2 years, a meaningful tail needs 5+.
 *  - annual cost: ~$75k, near the national median for assisted living / a year
 *    of substantial home care (Genworth Cost of Care survey range).
