/**
 * Federal income tax (planning-grade), replacing the V1 flat placeholder.
 *
 * Computation order per year:
 *   1. Taxable Social Security via provisional income (unindexed thresholds)
 *   2. AGI = ordinary + capital gains + taxable SS. Tax-exempt interest and
 *      income excluded under the §911/§931/§933 foreign and possessions
 *      exclusions affect §86 provisional income without becoming ordinary
 *      income or entering AGI directly. MAGI restores those exclusions
 *      (§1411(d), §151(d)(5)(C)(iii)(II)).
 *   3. Deductions: the greater of the standard deduction (with age-65
 *      additions) or itemized SALT (capped) + mortgage interest + charitable,
 *      plus the OBBBA senior deduction on top of whichever base wins
 *      (2025–2028, per-person 6%-of-MAGI phase-out)
 *   4. Ordinary brackets on non-preferential taxable income
 *   5. LTCG/qualified-dividend stacking at 0/15/20% on top of ordinary
 *   6. NIIT 3.8% on investment income over the (unindexed) MAGI threshold
 *   7. Planning-grade AMT screen: modeled add-backs/preference items (the §63(c)
 *      standard deduction or itemized SALT, plus the §151 senior deduction on
 *      either branch per §56(b)(1)(D)), AMT exemption/phaseout, and
 *      preferential-rate-aware tentative minimum tax.
 *
 * Every figure is read from the year's parameter pack. For a year no pack has
 * been published for, the caller supplies `inflationScale` and the annually
 * indexed figures -- rate brackets, standard deduction and age-65 addition,
 * capital-gain breakpoints, AMT exemption/phase-out/28% threshold -- are
 * carried forward with it (`indexFederalTaxPack`). The unindexed ones are not:
 * the section 86 provisional-income tiers and the section 1411 NIIT thresholds
 * stay put by design, which is why more of a benefit becomes taxable and more
 * income meets NIIT as a plan runs on.
 *
 * Out of scope here (see DOCS/features/taxes.md): credits, full Form 6251
 * adjustments, the rest of Schedule A and the OBBBA high-income SALT
 * phase-out, early-withdrawal penalties (projection-level), IRMAA
 * (expense-side), state.
