/**
 * Zod-free metadata for the Plan JSON Schema.
 *
 * This module deliberately imports NOTHING from `zod` or `../model/plan.js`, so
 * that the `@retiregolden/engine/schema` barrel — which re-exports these plus the
 * generated `planJsonSchema` constant — stays a pure data surface. A consumer
 * (the MCP) can import the schema and its version without dragging zod or the
 * plan model into its module graph. The zod-backed generator lives separately in
 * `./generate.ts` (reachable at `@retiregolden/engine/schema/generate`).
 *
 * `PLAN_SCHEMA_VERSION` is asserted to equal the plan model's
 * `CURRENT_PLAN_SCHEMA_VERSION` both at generation time (see `generatePlanJsonSchema`)
 * and by a unit test, so this zod-free copy can never silently drift.

 * Constraints `parsePlan` enforces that the JSON Schema cannot express, so a

 * before trusting a document). Grouped by where they live in planSchema; keep
 * this list current when adding a `.refine`/`.superRefine` to the plan model.
 *
 * These are also embedded in the generated schema under
 * `x-retiregolden-unrepresentableConstraints`, so offline JSON-only readers of
 * `schema/plan.v1.json` get the same machine-readable catalog without importing
