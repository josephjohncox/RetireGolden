/**
 * The latest `startAge` a QUALIFIED annuity purchase that is not a QLAC may
 * carry, for an owner born in `birthYear` who pays the premium in
 * `purchaseYear`.
 *
 * Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)(9)-5(a)(5)(iii) permits a portion of an account to buy a
 * contract while the rest stays behind, but only if the contract itself
 * satisfies 1.401(a)(9)-6 — whose paragraph (a)(3)(i) requires annuity payments
 * to commence on or before the required beginning date. Paragraph (q)(1)(iii)
 * excuses a QLAC from (a)(3) and nothing else is excused, so a contract that
 * DEFERS past that date without being a QLAC is a shape the regulation does not
 * permit. The whole test is derivable from facts a Plan already carries, which
 * is why no new field is added for it.
 *
 * TWO TERMS, and the second is the one that keeps this a rule about deferral
 * rather than about age.
 *
 * The first term is the required beginning date itself. Under
 * 1.401(a)(9)-2(b)(1) it is April 1 of the calendar year FOLLOWING the year the
 * owner attains the applicable age, so the last calendar year in which payments
 * may commence is the year the owner attains that age plus one — hence `+ 1`
 * and not a bare equality. The projection pays a contract twelve monthly
 * amounts in the year the owner attains `startAge` (`simulate.ts`, the
 * guaranteed-income pass), so the engine's own model of commencement is
 * January 1 of that year, which is before the April 1 deadline. Refusing at the
 * applicable age itself would refuse a contract the regulation admits.
 *
 * The second term is the purchase year, and without it this function refuses
 * the ordinary immediate annuity. An owner who annuitizes at 80 passed their
 * required beginning date years ago; every contract they could possibly buy
 * commences after it, so the first term alone would forbid a purchase the
 * regulation plainly allows and that this engine's own Form 8606 fixtures are
 * built on. What (a)(3)(i) is doing there is requiring that the annuity form not
 * be used to postpone distributions, and a contract paying from the year its
 * premium is paid postpones nothing: the account was already distributing under
 * the account rules, and the contract takes over on purchase. Taking the later
 * of the two terms is therefore the strictest bound the annual model can state
 * that still admits an immediate purchase — commence by the required beginning
 * date, or, if that date has gone, by the purchase itself.
 */

/**
 * The latest `startAge` a QLAC may carry, for an owner born in month
 * `birthMonth` (1–12).
 *
 * The companion bound to the one above, and the reason that one is not the
 * whole rule. Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)(9)-6(q)(1)(iii) excuses a QLAC from
 * (a)(3)(i)'s "commence by the required beginning date", so the function above
 * stands aside for a QLAC — but the excuse is not a licence to defer forever.
 * Paragraph (q)(1)(ii) puts its own ceiling on the same contract: the contract
 * must PROVIDE a specified annuity starting date "no later than the first day of
 * the month next following the 85th anniversary of the employee's birth". A
 * contract that names a later date is not a QLAC at all, so it holds neither
 * (q)(1)(iii)'s excuse nor 1.401(a)(9)-5(b)(4)'s exclusion from the required-
 * distribution account balance, and the engine's one mechanism — the premium
 * leaves the traditional balance at purchase and an annuity account holds no
 * balance of its own — would hand it both.
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWER IS A BIRTH MONTH AND NOT THE CONSTANT 85. The regulation's
 * deadline is a DATE, and this model's start ages are calendar years. The
 * bridge between them is the same one the required-beginning-date bound above
 * is built on: `simulatePlan` pays a contract twelve monthly amounts in the
 * calendar year the owner attains `startAge` (`startCalendarYear = dobYear +
 * startAge`, the guaranteed-income pass), so the engine's model of commencement
 * is January 1 of that year. Ask of each candidate start age whether that
 * January 1 falls on or before the deadline:
 *
 *  - `startAge` 85 or lower puts commencement at January 1 of the year the
 *    owner attains 85 or earlier. The deadline is at the earliest February 1 of
 *    that same year (a January birthday), so every such contract clears it.
 *  - `startAge` 86 puts commencement at January 1 of the year the owner attains
 *    86. For an owner born in any month but December the deadline fell in the
 *    PREVIOUS calendar year, so the contract is late. For an owner born in
 *    December the 85th anniversary is in December and the first day of the next
 *    month IS that January 1 — the contract commences on the last day the
 *    regulation permits, exactly.
 *  - `startAge` 87 or higher is late for everyone.
 *
 * So the ceiling is 85, and 86 for a December birth. The December case is not a
 * rounding artefact to be tidied away: it is the same arithmetic that gives the
 * bound above its `+ 1`, which exists because THAT deadline (April 1 of the
 * year following attainment) also falls in the calendar year after the one the
 * age names. Refusing 86 for a December-born owner would be a refusal stricter
 * than the authority for it, and would force that household to model a contract
 * commencing a full year before the one they hold.
