   *      the household; its charitable exclusion reaches the LP separately, as
   *      `forcedDistributionOrdinaryIncomeExclusion` below.
   *   2. a 72(t) SEPP series payment, which debits its account every series
   *      year. Its ordinary income is already booked inside
   *      `ordinaryIncomeBase` and the LP re-decides none of the movement —
   *      `incumbentTraditionalDistribution` excludes `seppTotal` — so income
   *      was charged with no debit until this carried it.
   *   3. an annuity purchase premium, which leaves an LP bucket for a contract
   *      the LP does not carry.
   *   4. a TIPS-ladder purchase, the same transfer in the same direction (its
   *      own block says so): the price leaves an LP bucket for a ladder the LP
   *      carries in no bucket, and the rungs pay back through
   *      `incomes.tipsLadder`, already inside `exogenousCash`.
   *   5. an elected pension lump sum, which rolls the commuted offer INTO the
   *      named traditional account (`simulate.ts`, the `rolloverInflow` block)
   *      while the pension stream stops paying. The LP already saw the stream
   *      vanish out of `exogenousCash`; booking only that half made the solve
   *      poorer than the household by the whole offer, for the rest of the
   *      horizon.
   *
   * NOT reported here, and correctly so: the RMD-routed part of the same gift.
   * Those dollars leave through the RMD, which the LP re-decides as its own
   * `wt` variable, so booking them here would debit the bucket twice. Their
   * CASH side is `forcedDistributionCashDiversion` below, which is a different
   * kind of correction — a credit the LP made on its own variable, not a
   * movement this channel could report.
   *
   * KNOWN AND ABSENT, and one class rather than a list: cash and value crossing
   * between the household and an asset the LP carries in NO bucket, where there
   * is no far side for it to book. A planned property sale's net proceeds
   * (`propertySaleProceedsTotal` in `baseCashInflows`, and the legacy
   * `expectedNetProceeds` deposit in the property-events block) — whose GAIN
   * the LP is already charged, through `preWithdrawalCapitalResult` into
   * `capitalGainsBase`; a permanent-life death benefit deposited by the
   * insurance block; and a HECM draw (`hecmDraw`).
   *
   * ALL FOUR OMISSIONS — the two property-sale paths, the HECM draw, and
   * the death benefit — RUN IN THE SAME DIRECTION: they make the solve POORER
   * than the household, which is why omitting them is the conservative answer
   * until the channel and the bucket that would carry them exist. The HECM draw
   * is measured, not assumed — the draw funds the ledger's own spending while
   * the probe reports `exogenousCash` of 0 and the full `spendingNeed`, so the
   * LP funds the whole year out of buckets the household never had to touch.
   * What is special about it is not its direction but its FIX: booking the
   * draw's cash ALONE, with no bucket for the loan balance it creates and
   * accrues, would flip the solve from poorer to richer and hand it a line of
   * free money it never repays. That is why it needs a debt bucket rather than
   * a cash credit, and why it cannot ride this channel. A separate slice.
   *
   * Read back off what each producer published — the year's runtime
   * OCCURRENCES for the gift, the series and the lump sum (the occurrence is
   * emitted at the mutation site for every account shape the block can reach,
   * where the runtime APPLICATION is gated on `isAggregatedIra`: a SEPP may run
   * on an employer plan and a lump sum may roll into one), and a mutation-site
   * capture for the two purchases (the annuity premium's occurrence is emitted
   * only for a traditional funding source, and a TIPS-ladder purchase publishes
   * none at all). Never re-derived from the strategy or election that asked, so
   * a movement the arm capped, truncated, skipped as sub-cent, or could not

   * Plan order is real and load-bearing for this policy (it decides the owner

   * it lives in `plan.accounts` and is recovered by joining on it, which is
   * exactly what `optimizerAggregateConversionPromotion.ts` does before it
   * allocates. A caller that iterates these keys instead is reading an order
   * this field never had.
   *
   * These are the exact figures
   * `actions/aggregateRothConversionOwnerAllocation.ts` read, captured at the
   * instant it read them: after the year's forced distributions (Treas. Reg.
   * 1.408A-4 A-6(b) puts the RMD first) and before anything below drains a
   * source. They are pre-drain by definition, so they are not the year's
   * closing balances and never agree with `balances` for a converting account.
   *
   * WHY IT IS PUBLISHED. The optimizer's promotion path has to name whose
   * dollars moved, out of which account, into which — and the owner weights
   * that decide it are a fact about this projection, not about the Plan. A
   * promotion that re-derived them from the Plan's opening balances, or from
   * any other year's, would put a second-source number on a schedule a person
   * is invited to act on. This field is what the ledger saw.
   *
   * THE SET IS EXACTLY `participatesInAggregateRothConversionAllocation`:
   * every owned non-inherited traditional account (employer plans included)
   * and every Roth account of both kinds. A designated Roth account is in it
   * although no conversion may land in one, because it is what tells an owner
   * who holds only that kind apart from an owner who holds no Roth at all.
   * Nothing else is: cash, taxable, equity compensation, HSA, inherited
   * traditional, property and debt are absent because the policy reads none of
   * them.
   *
   * WHY IT MIGHT BE ABSENT, in full. `simulatePlan` publishes it for exactly
   * the years in which the aggregate allocation policy ran, so absence means
   * one of:
   *
   * - the year had a named conversion request, which makes the named executor
   *   authoritative and forces the aggregate mode to `none`;
   * - the Plan's conversion strategy is `mode: 'none'`;
   * - nobody in the household was alive in the year;
   * - a `fillToTarget` strategy whose window does not cover the year;
   * - a `fillToTarget` sizing that produced nothing to convert — an invalid
   *   bracket target, non-actionable ACA evidence, a safety-net floor trim, or
   *   simply no headroom — or a `manual`/`optimized` schedule with no entry for
   *   the year; in every one of those the sized household amount failed the
   *   `> 0.01` test and the policy was never called;
   * - the `YearResult` was constructed by an external consumer rather than by
   *   `simulatePlan`, which is what the optionality is for.
   *
   * Presence says the policy was asked, and nothing more. It does not say the
   * household converted: the policy may have refused it for want of any Roth
   * IRA, or trimmed an owner who has none, and the year then publishes this
   * snapshot beside a `rothConversion` of zero.
