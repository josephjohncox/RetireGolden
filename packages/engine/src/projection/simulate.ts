/**
 * Deterministic annual-ledger simulation (roadmap V1).
 *
 * Year ordering: ages → income → expenses (incl. debt service) → capped
 * contributions → fixed-point tax/withdrawal iteration → apply flows →
 * property events → growth → snapshot. All amounts are nominal dollars;
 * today's-dollar display is a render-time transform.
 *
 * V1 simplifications (each lifts in a later roadmap phase):
 * - Wages, contributions, base spending, and goals inflate at the general rate;
 *   wages are paid while the person's attained age is BELOW their retirement
 *   age and stop from the first year it is not. A whole retirement age of 65 is
 *   therefore last paid at attained 64; a fractional 65.5 is last paid at
 *   attained 65 and first unpaid at attained 66.
 * - SS COLA compounds from the projection start, and first-year benefits are
 *   prorated by claim months only (no birthday-month precision). PIA comes
 *   from the stream directly or from its earnings history (AIME → bend
 *   points). The earnings test withholds own, spousal, and survivor benefits
 *   annually ($1/$2 below FRA, $1/$3 in the FRA year) and credits the withheld
 *   months back at FRA (ARF, annual approximation). Spousal benefits apply the
 *   retirement/survivor family maximum; survivors step up to the deceased's
 *   benefit with the early-claim widow(er) reduction and RIB-LIM widow's-limit cap.
 * - RMDs are forced from traditional accounts at SECURE 2.0 start ages
 *   (Uniform Lifetime Table; no April-1 first-year deferral). QCDs route
 *   charitable dollars out of the RMD (age 70½ ≈ age attained 71).
 *   Early-withdrawal penalties: 10% traditional pre-59½ (≈ age < 60), 20%
 *   HSA non-medical pre-65. Healthcare expenses: ACA-credited marketplace
 *   premiums pre-65 (credit vs prior-year MAGI; 400% FPL cliff), Medicare
 *   Part B + IRMAA (MAGI 2-year lookback) + Part D surcharge + extras from
 *   65. Roth conversions run after RMDs (manual amounts or fill-to-target
 *   sized against the federal engine; conversion taxes ride the normal
 *   withdrawal flow, so they come from cash/taxable first and are never
 *   penalized). Annuities end at owner death; pensions pay survivorPct to a
 *   surviving spouse once payments have started.
 * - Contribution limits beyond the latest parameter pack are indexed forward
 *   at the assumed inflation rate (statutory limits are inflation-indexed).

 * a 500 step therefore accumulates and eventually carries the amount up a full
 * step. That is the shape of the published 415(d)-indexed tables, where a limit
 * holds for a year or two and then moves a full 500 at once. Note the engine
 * does not reproduce that shape for the limits it projects smoothly through

    // "Notwithstanding section 72, in determining the extent to which a
    // distribution is a qualified charitable distribution, the entire amount of
    // the distribution shall be treated as includible in gross income ... to the
    // extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate amount which would
    // have been so includible if all amounts in all individual retirement plans
    // of the individual were distributed during such taxable year and all such
    // plans were treated as 1 contract ... Proper adjustments shall be made in
    // applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year".
    //
    // Three things follow, and this block is all three:
    //
    // 1. THE CEILING is the owner's whole aggregate includible amount --
    //    pre-distribution aggregated owned-IRA balance minus aggregate basis --
    //    and not the taxable share of this year's requirement. A required
    //    distribution is a small fraction of a balance, so the statutory ceiling
    //    is normally far higher and simply does not bind.
    // 2. THE GIFT RETURNS NO BASIS, because (D) deems it to consist of
    //    includible dollars. So `qcdIncomeOffset` is the routed GROSS.
    // 3. THE PROPER ADJUSTMENT for the year's other distributions is the one the
    //    Form 8606 line-7 instructions spell out -- "Don't include any of the
    //    following on line 7 ... Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs)" --
    //    so the gift leaves the line-7 numerator AND the annual denominator,
    //    while the whole of the year's basis survives as the numerator of the
    //    ratio. Line 6 is already net of the gift and line 7 never gains it, so
    //    the denominator is the pre-distribution pool less the qualified gift.
    //
    // This is the same arithmetic the named arm settles in exact cents --
    // `annualQcdTaxCharacterPostPass.ts`, registered as
    // `irc-408-d-8-D-qcd-taxable-first`, where the residual denominator is
    // likewise `taxablePoolGrossBalanceBefore − qualifiedCharitableDistribution`
    // against an unreduced basis numerator. Reaching it here required deferring
    // the forced distributions' splits past the gift, not a second derivation.
    //
    // A gift that runs past the aggregate includible amount is NOT a QCD in the
    // excess, under (D) read with (B)'s closing sentence ("A distribution shall
    // be treated as a qualified charitable distribution only to the extent that
    // the distribution would be includible in gross income"). The excess is an
    // ordinary distribution: it stays in the denominator, stays on line 7, and
    // recovers basis. It is charged against the from-RMD half of the gift first,
    // where those dollars are already inside `rmdTotal` and inside the line-7
    // gross, so no term has to be invented for them; only what is left over is
    // carried on `qcdNonQualifiedOrdinaryIncome` below.
    //
    // (d)(8)(A)'s own limit is separate and applies earlier: `requested` is
    // already capped at the year's sourced annual limit, so the exclusion can
    // never exceed it and no second clamp is needed here. The (A) reduction for

     * year's fraction is owner-wide and `splitIraDistribution` caps every draw

     * gift was routed out of a required distribution, that was exactly the shape
     * `ownedNonRothIraRuntimeSourceSeries.ts` refused with `qcdStageRequired`,
     * and `assumedEffects` was empty for the whole year. The refusal is gone.
     * The nonmoving overlay now carries the per-owner attribution settled just
     * above -- the routed gross, and the qualified part of it -- and the source
     * series carves that qualified amount out of the owner's line-7 gross by
     * walking the same applications in the same mutation order this loop walks
     * its entries in.
     *
     * SO THE ORDER HERE IS LOAD-BEARING, where it used to be arbitrary. The
     * settlement matches an assumed effect only when its gross agrees to the
     * cent, so an entry whose carve the replay placed differently would find no
     * effect and fall back to the pro-rata computation -- correct, but not
     * settled. Greedy-in-mutation-order on both sides is what makes the two
     * agree; the owner's TOTAL basis recovery would be the same either way,
     * which is why the choice is free and why it has to be the same choice.
     *
     * `splitWithAssumedCharacter` is therefore what is called, and its fallback
     * is the honest one for an entry no effect describes: a settlement effect
     * computed for a whole distribution does not describe the part that went to

     * the same fraction of basis as every other distribution the aggregate

     * exactly the way `rmdNontaxable` does for a required distribution.
     *
     * IT DRAWS ON NO FALLBACK, and that is deliberate. Where the settlement
     * publishes nothing for a payment, the payment stays fully ordinary rather
     * than being split against the legacy pro-rata state. That state is opened
     * on a pre-distribution pool the contract is NOT in, so splitting against
     * it would hand the payment a share of a fraction computed as though the

     * ASKED UNDER THE POOL OWNER, which is the funding IRA's and not the
     * contract's. The settlement allocates the year's basis one owner-wide
     * aggregate at a time and publishes each effect under that owner, so a
     * lookup keyed on the contract's own `ownerPersonId` finds nothing whenever
     * a Plan names one spouse's contract against the other's IRA -- and finding
     * nothing here is silent, because the settlement has already spent the
     * basis on the allocation it published. The recovery is charged to the same

     *
     * Read at the seam and not at each executor's own call site, because the
     * question a staging release has to answer is about *both* legs before
     * *either* moves.
     *
     * Be precise about what this read is and is not. It is **per action**, and
     * it is **not aggregated** — not across a group's two legs, and not across
     * groups. Disjointness holds between one group's own two legs, because a
     * conversion may only source an owned non-inherited traditional IRA and an
     * ordinary withdrawal may only source cash, equity compensation or taxable;
     * that is what makes each leg's answer independent of the other's movement.
     * It does not extend to a year holding two groups whose withdrawals draw on
     * one cash account: each can be individually fundable while their sum is
     * not, and this read will say yes to both.
     *
     * So this is a *precondition for staging*, never a proof of movement. What
     * actually makes the release safe is that the staging run then moves the
     * legs for real and is read for what happened: a withdrawal the account
     * could not cover comes back short or refused,
     * `withdrawalLegsMovedWhole` revokes, `movementCoherent` goes false, and
     * `authorizeConversionLinkedWithdrawalGroups` withholds. The seam read
     * earns its place by turning the common case into a clean refusal instead
     * of a staging run that has to be discarded through a throw — not by
     * deciding anything on its own.

      //     leave the household, so there is no cash side to book — the whole
      //     point of a gift — while its charitable exclusion reaches the LP
      //     through `forcedDistributionOrdinaryIncomeExclusion` above.
      //   - a 72(t) SEPP series payment, which debits its account every series
      //     year. Its ORDINARY INCOME is already booked (`incomeBeforeConversion`
      //     carries `+ seppTotal − seppNontaxable`, so it survives into
      //     `ordinaryIncomeBase`), and the LP re-decides none of the movement:
      //     `incumbentTraditionalDistribution` below is the RMD plus
      //     discretionary owner draws and excludes `seppTotal` entirely. Income
      //     charged with no debit is the same one-sided booking as the gift,
      //     with the sides swapped. Unlike the gift it DOES deliver cash — the
      //     ledger's `baseCashInflows` carries `+ seppTotal` — so it reports
      //     proceeds and the gift does not.
      //   - an annuity purchase premium, which leaves an LP bucket for a
      //     contract the LP does not carry. No proceeds: the premium buys the
      //     contract, and the contract pays back later through
      //     `incomes.annuity`, which is already inside `exogenousCash`.
      //   - a TIPS-ladder purchase, which is the same transfer in the same
      //     direction — its own block says so — leaving an LP bucket for a
      //     ladder the LP carries in no bucket, and paying back later through
      //     `incomes.tipsLadder`, also already inside `exogenousCash`. No
      //     proceeds, for the premium's reason.
      //   - an elected pension lump sum, the one producer that CREDITS. It
      //     rolls the commuted offer into the named traditional account while
      //     the pension stream stops paying, so the LP already sees half the
      //     fact: the income vanishes out of `exogenousCash` in that year and
      //     every year after. Booking only that half made the solve poorer than
      //     the household by the whole offer, compounding for the rest of the
      //     horizon. No proceeds either, and for a reason the other four do not
      //     share: nothing arrives in hand. It is a DIRECT rollover — the money
      //     goes plan-to-IRA, never through the year's cash flow, which is also
      //     why it puts no income on the return for the bracket terms to price.
      //
      // Read back off what each producer published, never re-derived from the
      // strategy or election that asked for it. The QCD arm caps its request at
      // the year's annual limit, truncates a draining take to whole cents,
      // skips a take the ledger records as zero, and gives nothing at all when
      // a named QCD stands it down; the SEPP arm skips a sub-cent payment and
      // clamps to the remaining balance; a purchase is clamped to what the
      // funding account could actually spend. Every one of those is a place a
      // parallel recomputation would drift, and a published movement cannot.
      // The runtime OCCURRENCE is the record used rather than the runtime
      // application, because the application is gated on `isAggregatedIra` — a
      // SEPP may run on an employer plan, and a lump sum may roll into one —
      // while the occurrence is emitted at the mutation site for every account
      // shape its own block can reach. Two producers publish no occurrence that
      // covers their whole reach: the annuity premium emits one only for a
      // traditional source, and the TIPS-ladder purchase emits none at all, so
      // both arrive through `exogenousStrategyDebits`, captured at their own
      // mutation sites.
      //
      // The QCD's RMD-routed part (`qcdFromRmd`) is deliberately NOT here:
      // those dollars leave the IRA through the RMD, which the LP re-decides as
      // its own `wt`, so booking them would debit the bucket twice. `legacyQcd`
      // occurrences are the arm's beyond-RMD takes alone. Their CASH side is a
      // separate term (`forcedDistributionCashDiversion` above), because that
      // is a credit the LP made on its own `wt` rather than a movement this
      // channel could take back.
      //
      // KNOWN AND ABSENT, so this channel's contract is not read as a universal
      // claim. What remains is one class, not a list of unrelated holes: cash
      // and value that cross between the household and an asset the LP carries
      // in NO bucket, where the LP has no way to book the far side.
      //   - a planned property sale's net proceeds join `baseCashInflows`
      //     (`propertySaleProceedsTotal`, the exact-taxed path) or land
      //     straight in a cash/taxable account (the legacy `expectedNetProceeds`
      //     path, in the property-events block below), and the LP sees neither
      //     — though it is already charged the sale's gain, which rides into
      //     `capitalGainsBase` through `preWithdrawalCapitalResult`. That is
      //     tax with no cash, the SEPP's defect shape.
      //   - a coordinated or backstop HECM draw adds `hecmDraw` to the year's
      //     cash and the same dollars to a loan balance that accrues.
      //   - a permanent-life death benefit is deposited into a cash/taxable
      //     account (the insurance block below) from a policy the LP does not
      //     carry.
      // ALL FOUR — the two property-sale paths, the HECM draw, and the death
      // benefit — RUN THE SAME WAY: they make the solve POORER than the
      // household, which is why omitting them is the conservative answer while
      // the shape that would fix them — a channel for assets outside the four
      // buckets, and a bucket for the debt — is designed. The HECM draw is
      // measured rather than assumed: it funds the ledger's own spending while
      // this probe reports `exogenousCash` of 0 and the whole `spendingNeed`,
      // so the LP pays for the year out of buckets the household never touched.
      // What sets it apart is its FIX, not its direction — booking the draw's
      // cash ALONE, with no bucket for the loan it creates, would flip the
      // solve from poorer to richer and hand it a line of free money it never
      // repays. That is a separate slice, and a debt bucket is part of it.

     * The cost is real and bounded: a year with no linked group runs nothing
     * extra, and a year with one doubles that year's passes.
     *
     * Every refusal returns null, and null is not a failure the year has to
     * survive — it is the ordinary answer for a year with no group, no
     * unambiguous filing unit, or a counterfactual that could not be restored.
